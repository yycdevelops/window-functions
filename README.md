# Signal Processing Windows

A simple library written in Rust to generate Window Functions used in Signal processing. 

## Description

This repository provides a simple implementation of Windowing functions written in Rust and ported over from a C++ library. It produces the windows functions provided in Matlab and numpy. 

## Getting Started

The library was written so that there are limited, if any external dependencies..

## Implemented Window Functions

The following Window functions are available:

 - Hamming 
 - Hanning
 - Blackman 
 - Barlette

A full comprehensive list will be updated as more window functions are implemented. 

## Testing 

A testing model has been created and can be ran using `cargo t`
